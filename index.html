            <h1 id="home">Summer Game Jam</h1>
            <p>Hey everyone! Thanks so much for joining the summer game jam. Thanks Nic for coordinating the idea and
                the theme. Ill be coordinating the communications and other things.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 id="info">Information</h2>
            <p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
            <p>There are not many rules. External resources like ChatGPT are allowed for referencing but you are not
                allowed to directly
                copy and paste code. Also please write your own code - don't just copy and paste entire project files.

                Your game must be open sourced when you're done (So we can look at the code when we judge it)</p>
            <p><strong>Theme</strong></p>
            <p>The theme for this years game jam is <mark>Heat is a mechanic</mark>. As the theme states you must use
                heat as a mechanic throughout the game.</p>
            <p><strong>Programming languages / Software</strong></p>
            <p>You can use any programming language or any software such as Python and Unity.</p>
